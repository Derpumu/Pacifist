# Pacifist Factorio mod

A mod to remove military items, recipes, and technologies, so you can concentrate on building useful things in peaceful mode.

## Compatibility with other mods

It is in the nature of the mod and the broad approach to remove all things military, that it won't play well with other mods that rely on military equipment, weapons, and so on.

Often that kind of issue can be resolved by loading Pacifist after those other mods, which is a matter of a single line of code in Pacifist.
In other cases, a workaround can be implemented in Pacifist, but sometimes, a fix has to be done in the other mod, so it handles the absence of military items well.

When you spot an incompatibility with another mod, please don't hesitate to submit an issue (if there is not already one open), and I'll have a look whether it can be fixed quickly.

### Overhaul mod compatibility roadmap
Incompatibilities are usually easier to solve in smaller mods.
When it comes to larger overhaul mods like Krastorio and Angel's Industries that change science and other things, making them compatible can be a lot of work - but I am on it.  

The current list of overhaul mods that I'd like to establish compatibility for can be found in the [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Pacifist).
