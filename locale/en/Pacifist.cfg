gleba-briefing=[planet=gleba] is a humid swampy planet with rich exotic vegetation that can be cultivated using [entity=agricultural-tower] and processed in the [entity=biochamber].\nYou can't find [entity=iron-ore], [entity=copper-ore], [entity=crude-oil], [entity=coal], and [entity=uranium-ore] there but plants provide alternative ways of producing needed items.\nMost of the items from agriculture come with the added challenge of spoiling over time. Even [item=agricultural-science-pack] has limited lifespan and can't be stockpiled.\n[entity=solar-panel] is weaker but still usable.
