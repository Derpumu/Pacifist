[mod-setting-description]
pacifist-remove-walls=After all, there are no biters to keep out.\nThis setting may only remove gates if other mods would not work without walls.
pacifist-remove-shields=Unless you have a habit of getting hit by cars or trains.\nThis setting may be ineffective if other mods would not work without shields.
pacifist-remove-armor=This removes armor that does not have neither an equipment grid nor inventory size bonus.
pacifist-remove-tank=Check this if you're okay not being able to drive through forests.\nNote that vehicles don't have guns either way.
pacifist-remove-pollution=Intended to be used along with disabling pollution.\nRemoves pollution-related properties from entities and modules.
